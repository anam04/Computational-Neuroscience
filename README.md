Hello,
I am Anam Ahamed, a sophomore studying at the Ashoka University.
I curated a a Computational Neuroscience Project which shows the **Simulation of Visual Cortex Edge Detection with Gabor Filters**.
This project simulates how the **biologically inspired simulation of V1 visual cortex cells, demonstrating edge/orientation detection using Gabor filters with interactive visualizations**.

## üîç Project Overview

- Modeled V1 simple & complex cells with 2D Gabor filters.
- Applied a multi-orientation filter bank for edge detection.
- Computed orientation-specific energy & combined responses.
- Demonstrated **contrast invariance** on natural images (cat sample).
- Produced interactive visualizations of orientation maps.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Google Colab
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-image`, `tensorflow` (all the libraries that have been used to build this project)
- Custom module: [`gwp`](https://www.johancarlin.com/gabor-filter-models-for-visual-neuroscience.html) (by Johan Carlin)

## ü§ù Acknowledgments

Based on Johan Carlin's Gabor filter model(https://www.johancarlin.com/). I am grateful to Professor Bittu for guidance throughout the course, which fostered engaging discussions and a deeper understanding of the subject. I would also like to thank Aryan and Manas for their valuable contributions to classroom discussions and presentations during this ISM.
